# Drip by team "Cot Topic"

Many of us lead busy lives, with fashion being an integral part of our identity. However, fashion can often be cumbersome, especially when waking up early and rushing to leave on time for our responsibilities. That’s why we invented “Drip”, a weather based fashion app. 

The flow starts with creating an account. Drip automatically has a preset wardrobe with common items of clothing: pants, shorts, hoodies, etc. However, it is easy to add or remove these items, and easier still to dive deeper and add all of your different items of clothing. Drip will work well either way. 

Drip also learns from your preferences, every morning it greets you with a number of wardrobe ideas. You choose which one you go with in the app, or none of them. Drip will take the combinations you have into account, and tailor your suggestions to your choices.
